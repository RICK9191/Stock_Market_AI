### Bitcoin Simulation Example

To simulate Bitcoin's price change, we can use a model like the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), which is commonly used for financial assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies due to its simplicity and the fact that it incorporates key aspects of asset behavior: drift and volatility.

GBM assumes that the log returns of the asset price are normally distributed and that the price follows a continuous-time stochastic process. The model is defined by the following differential equation:

St = St-1 * e^((μ - 0.5σ^2)Δt + σ√(Δt) * Z)

Where:

St is the asset price at time t,
μ is the "drift" or the expected return of the asset,
σ is the "volatility" of the asset,
Δt is the time step (usually in days),
Z is a standard normal random variable.

To simulate Bitcoin's price using GBM, we'll need:

The current price of Bitcoin.
An estimate of the historical volatility of Bitcoin.
An estimate of the drift term, which we can derive from historical returns.

For simplicity, let's use some hypothetical values:

Current Bitcoin price: $20,000
Estimated annual volatility (σ): 50%
Estimated annual drift (μ): 10%

We'll simulate the price for the next 365 days. Let's proceed with the simulation.

The simulation above illustrates a possible path for Bitcoin's price over the next 365 days based on the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. The starting price was set at $20,000, with an estimated annual drift (expected return) of 10% and an annual volatility of 50%.

Keep in mind that this is just one of many potential paths Bitcoin's price could follow, and actual future prices will be influenced by a multitude of factors not captured in this simple model. This simulation is intended to provide a conceptual illustration rather than a prediction.
